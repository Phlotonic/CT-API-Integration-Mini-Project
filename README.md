# Pokedex Web Application

This project is a web application that provides a comprehensive Pokedex experience, allowing users to explore Pokémon data, build teams, and simulate battles. It's built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, and it integrates with the PokeAPI to fetch and display Pokémon information.

## Features

*   **Homepage:** A visually appealing landing page with an introduction to the application.
*   **Search Page:** Search for Pokémon by name or ID and view basic information.
*   **Details Page:** View detailed information about a specific Pokémon, including stats, abilities, moves, and evolution chain.
*   **Types Page:** Explore Pokémon by type, with a dropdown menu to filter by type.
*   **Abilities Page:** View a list of all abilities and their descriptions.
*   **Moves Page:** Explore a list of all moves and their details.
*   **Generations Page:** Browse Pokémon by generation.
*   **Team Builder:** Create and customize Pokémon teams using drag-and-drop or click-to-add functionality.
*   **Battle Simulator:** Simulate Pokémon battles with basic battle mechanics, AI for the opponent, and an interactive UI for move selection.

## Current Status

The project is currently at about 70-80% functionality. Most of the core features are implemented, but there are still some areas that need further development and refinement:

*   **Team Builder Integration:** The team builder needs to be fully integrated with the battle simulator to allow users to use their custom teams in battles.
*   **Battle Simulator Enhancements:** The battle simulator needs more thorough testing and improvement, including more complex battle mechanics, refined AI, and potentially additional features like status effects and abilities.
*   **UI/UX Improvements:** There is room for improvement in the overall UI/UX of the application, including better styling, responsiveness, and user feedback.

## Future Development

We are looking for more developers to contribute to this project and help us bring it to 100% functionality. Here are some areas where we could use help:

*   **Complete team builder integration.**
*   **Enhance the battle simulator with more advanced mechanics.**
*   **Improve the UI/UX of the application.**
*   **Add more features, such as a "My Teams" page to save and manage teams.**
*   **Implement user authentication and data persistence.**
*   **Improve code organization and documentation.**
